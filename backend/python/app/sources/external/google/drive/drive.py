The literal `*/*` is only used to indicate that any valid MIME type can be uploaded. For more information on uploading files, see [Upload file data](/workspace/drive/api/guides/manage-uploads). Apps creating shortcuts with `files.create` must specify the MIME type `application/vnd.google-apps.shortcut`.

For example, an operation to insert a JPEG file should specify something like `"name": "cat.jpg"` in the metadata. Subsequent `GET` requests include the read-only `fileExtension` property populated with the extension originally specified in the `title` property. When a Google Drive user requests to download a file, or when the file is downloaded through the sync client, Drive builds a full filename (with extension) based on the title.

This field is sorted using alphabetical ordering, so 1, 12, 2, 22. * `name_natural`: The name of the file. This field is sorted using natural sort ordering, so 1, 2, 12, 22. * `quotaBytesUsed`: The number of storage quota bytes used by the file. * `recency`: The most recent timestamp from the file's date-time fields. * `sharedWithMeTime`: When the file was shared with the user, if applicable. * `starred`: Whether the user has starred the file. * `viewedByMeTime`: The last time the file was viewed by the user.
